## Who Will Answer the Question?

Sometimes the class becomes silent, and participation is unbalanced — a few students talk a lot while others remain quiet.  
How can we solve this?

### Form 1: Round-Robin
- Everyone takes turns answering the question.
- Take turns 

### Form 2: Pass It On
- The student who just answered picks the next person to respond.
- Keeps the discussion flowing and adds an element of surprise.

### Form 3: Lottery
- Randomly select a student using:
  - A number draw
  - Birthdays (e.g., students whose birthday starts with a certain month or date)
