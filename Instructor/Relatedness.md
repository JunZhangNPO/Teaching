### To What Degree Does the Lecture Relate to Students?

- Use students as examples; they might find it engaging and fun.  
- Learn about students' lived experiences and use them as examples (ensure students feel comfortable with this).  
- Incorporate examples they are familiar with, such as a local NGO in their community.  
- Introduce them to local government entities, such as the County Council.  
- Relate to celebrities they know, such as Taylor Swift's charitable activities.  
- Use recent news stories, such as the fire in Los Angeles.
