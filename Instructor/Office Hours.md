Ask students to send you what they have done before the office hour 
- Without their prior engagement , the effectiveness of the office hour will be low.

- Zoom or in-person meeting depends on the needs. Sometimes sharing screen is necessary.
- Ask feeback by: does it make sense to you/Did I explain it clearly?， rather than Did you understand it?
