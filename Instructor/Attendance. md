## Make Attendance Fun

### First Class: Icebreaker
- Use attendance as a chance for **self-introductions**.
- Each student shares:
  - Basic information (name, major, etc.)
  - One **fun fact** about themselves

### Ongoing Classes: Keep It Interesting
- Start each class by asking a student to share something **fun or interesting** they read or experienced that's related to the class topic.

### Interactive Attendance
- Rotate the responsibility of taking attendance:
  - Assign **one student each class** to take attendance.
  - This helps them get to know their classmates.
  - Challenge: Ask them to **name who is missing within 10 seconds**!
