## Mindset
- An accent is unavoidable as a non-native speaker.  
- It reflects who we are.  
- Rude comments about accents are unacceptable.  
- However, it is our responsibility to make communication clear, especially when talking with students.  
- We can improve our language, presentation style and explore methods to reduce the impact of an accent.  
- It is also a fun learning process.
- Your experience will be helpful other non-native speakers, especially your students. 


## Improve Language

- Learn life language from drama and daily communication 
- Do not rely much on AI tools


## Presentation Style 
- Speak slowly, pause when need
- Rehearsal
- Check pronounciation of key words
