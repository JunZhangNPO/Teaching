## Ask your students/audience what they need or expect

### Context
- Served as a teaching mentor for the TA orientation.
- In a small-group meeting, used a game-based activity to make the session engaging and to prompt reflection on lecture content.

### Feedback
- Some students did not enjoy the games and did not find them helpful.
- One student felt nervous about micro-teaching.
- Another student preferred more time to reflect on lectures.

### Takeaways
- Ask students about their goals and expectations before choosing activities.
- Use a balanced approach that combines discussion (traditional) and games (innovative).

### Next steps
- [ ] Open with a quick needs-and-expectations poll (2–3 minutes)
- [ ] Offer two paths: discussion-only or discussion + game
- [ ] Provide an opt-out for micro-teaching or add warm-up steps
- [ ] Collect structured feedback at the end to iterate

### Quick prompt to gather expectations (copy/paste)
- What do you most want from this session? (e.g., concrete tips, practice, reflection)
- Which format do you prefer? (discussion / activities / mixed)
- How comfortable are you with micro-teaching today? (1–5)
- Any constraints or concerns we should know about?
